				<h2>The invention of beer</h2><hr>
				<p>Beer is one of the oldest drinks known since the Neolithic era, along with honey, kvass and wine. According to some radical opinion, the cultivation of grain began for the sake of beer, not bread.</p>
				<p>The earliest evidence of brewing beer come from the area of ancient Iran and the Sumerian culture of <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%9C%D0%B5%D1%81%D0%BE%D0%BF%D0%BE%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%BC%D0%B8%D1%8F" target="_blank">Ancient Mesopotamia</a>, a period of about 3500-2900 BC Findings also show that around this time brewing engaged the Egyptians and later the Babylonians. From the Egyptians brewing was taken over by Jews.</p>
				<p>The beer is mentioned in ancient Egyptian and Mesopotamian sources starting from about 3000 BC.. The builders of the Egyptian pyramids received, in addition to food allowance, beer.</p>
				<p>Beer was widespread throughout the ancient world, in particular in <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%94%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%B2%D0%BD%D1%8F%D1%8F_%D0%93%D1%80%D0%B5%D1%86%D0%B8%D1%8F" target="_blank">Ancient Greece</a> and ancient Rome (although inferior in popularity wine), ancient Armenia, it was known to the Celts and German peoples. Beer was brewed from wheat, oats, rye, millet, barley and spelt. In <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%98%D1%81%D1%82%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B8%D1%8F_%D0%9A%D0%B8%D1%82%D0%B0%D1%8F" target="_blank">Ancient China</a> brewed beer from sprouted rice, as well as rice and fruit.</p>
				<p>Beer is usually produced in the Northern regions, where climatic conditions are not allowed to grow grapes.</p>
				<p>In the Early middle Ages, beer in Europe was produced mainly in monasteries. European monks professionally engaged in brewing, improved its technology; in particular, starting to use as a preservative hops.</p>
				<p>In the middle ages, beer was considered a drink for both adults and children — in contrast to the then drinking water beer, as a result of boiling, was devoid of pathogens. Also due to the high calorie content, beer was an additional food; in <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%93%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%BC%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%8F" target="_blank">Germany</a> today beer is called liquid bread (it. flüssiges Brot). In those days, beer was considered a drink of the poor, had a lower status compared to wine.</p>

				<h2>Classification of beer</h2>
				<div class="beer-type_img"></div>
				<div>
					<p>Currently, there is no single system of classification of beer in all its diversity. The views of American and European authors are somewhat different. However, there are some indications on which classification can be made.</p>
					<p>But there are established individual types of beer, here are some of them:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Gruit</li>
						<li>Pilsner</li>
						<li>Lager</li>
						<li>Porter</li>
						<li>Lambic</li>
						<li>Altbier</li>
					</ul>
					<h3>Classification by colour</h3>
					<p>The color of the finished beer naturally depends on the composition of the raw material, namely the presence in the original wort of dark malt, and in its presence — the number and degree of roasting of the latter. Classification of beer by its color is widespread in <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%A0%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%81%D0%B8%D1%8F" target="_blank">Russia</a>, as well as in some other European countries, for example, in <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%98%D1%81%D0%BF%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%8F" target="_blank">Spain</a>. There are light, dark, red, white and mixed beer. In the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%A1%D0%BE%D1%8E%D0%B7_%D0%A1%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B5%D1%82%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8%D1%85_%D0%A1%D0%BE%D1%86%D0%B8%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%B8%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B8%D1%87%D0%B5%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8%D1%85_%D0%A0%D0%B5%D1%81%D0%BF%D1%83%D0%B1%D0%BB%D0%B8%D0%BA" target="_blank">USSR</a>, the term semi-dark was used for some time. Mixed beer is the result, first of all, of the Czech beer consumption culture. It is obtained after mixing dark and light beer.</p>
					<h3>Classification by the composition of raw materials</h3>
					<p>In the European tradition, the main raw material for the preparation of beer is barley. In some Beers, barley malt is partially replaced by other grains (malt or non-sprouted grains). Thus, wheat beer is brewed with the addition of wheat malt or wheat (up to 50 %).</p>
					<p>Beer can be brewed on the basis of other cereals:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Rye beer</li>
						<li>Rice (for example, whole rice is made from Japanese sake) beer</li>
						<li>Corn (eg., Techwin, happoshu) beer</li>
					</ul>

			<h2 class="history">Beer quality</h2>
			<p>The tradition of determining the quality of beer through foam appeared in the medieval <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%A7%D0%B5%D1%85%D0%B8%D1%8F" target="_blank">Czech Republic</a>, but historically it was not its quantity, but its quality — resistance, density, the ability to hold objects on the surface for a certain time. Fresh high-quality foam for a minute should keep the coin or toothpick and not let it come into contact with the liquid, with any method of pouring the foam density does not change and not any foam will hold the match for a minute. The physical properties of the foam depend on the chemical composition of the beer. The negative or positive effects of chemical elements are studied and written on them in some Czech universities, for example, in the higher chemical-technical school of Prague.</p>
